Javascript code for various sensors that was used on SJSU Robotics's Labrador I rover.
You can find out more about the rover here https://www.nasa.gov/feature/5th-annual-robo-ops-challenge-simulates-teleoperations-and-sample-return-from-planetary

The Sensor.js included javscript code made for  Compass, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, GPS, Voltage Sensor, BeagleBone Black's CPU Temperature, and Wifi Signal Strenght.
More detail abouch each sensor is describe below.
